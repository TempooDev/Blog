Recently, I've been exploring the benefits of **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** in a microservices-based hotel reservation system. This project aims to design an architecture that enables
real-time interactions, improves scalability and maintainability, and simplifies integration between services.

This architecture will serve as the foundation upon which I will build the system.

## Key Concepts and Approaches

To achieve this goal, I've incorporated key concepts and approaches that have been fundamental in the process:

### 1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**

I restructured the application organization to clearly define domain boundaries and avoid unnecessary dependencies between modules. This has enabled greater clarity and modularity in the design.

### 2. **Microservices Architecture**

I designed a set of independent services that communicate with each other using lightweight protocols and APIs, allowing for loose coupling and scalability.

### 3. **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**

I implemented an event-driven approach to improve scalability and decouple services, enabling better management of distributed transactions. This allows for real-time interactions between services
and enables a more scalable architecture.

### 4. **Message Brokers**

I integrated message brokers such as RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka to handle the flow of events between services, allowing for reliable and efficient communication.

### 5. **API Gateways**

I implemented API gateways to manage incoming requests and outgoing responses, providing a single entry point for clients and simplifying integration with other services.

## Benefits Achieved

This combination of approaches has enabled:

* Real-time interactions between services, enabling a more responsive system.
* Improved scalability by allowing services to operate independently and asynchronously.
* Simplified integration between services, reducing coupling and complexity.
* Better management of distributed transactions, ensuring consistency and reliability.

## Next Steps

I will continue sharing progress and the challenges I encounter throughout the development of this system.
