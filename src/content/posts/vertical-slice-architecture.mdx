Recently, I have been working on modifying a **Vertical Slice Architecture** template to enhance the maintainability and scalability of microservices. This project aims to design an architecture based on **Azure ☁️** for reservation management, using **Event-Driven Architecture 🔄** to efficiently handle events and ensure asynchronous communication between services.  

This architecture will serve as the foundation upon which I will build the system.  

## Key Tools and Approaches  

To achieve this goal, I have incorporated a combination of architectures and tools that have been fundamental in the process:  

### 1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) 🏗️**  

I restructured the application organization to clearly define domain boundaries and avoid unnecessary dependencies between modules. This has enabled greater clarity and modularity in the design.  

### 2. **Screaming Architecture 📢**  

By prioritizing the expressiveness of the code structure, the folder and namespace organization now directly reflects the business domain instead of being coupled to technical details.  

### 3. **.NET Aspire 🚀**  

I integrated Aspire for service orchestration, simplifying dependency management, configuration, and local deployment of microservices.  

### 4. **Event-Driven Architecture ⚡**  

I implemented an event-driven approach to improve scalability and decouple services, enabling better management of distributed transactions.  

### 5. **Migration Service 🗄️**  

I added a specific service to manage database schema evolution, ensuring migrations are applied automatically and in a controlled manner.  

## Benefits Achieved  

This combination of approaches and tools has enabled:  

- Greater modularity and clarity in service development.

- Improved long-term maintainability.  

- Simplified integration and deployment of services in both local and cloud environments, thanks to Aspire.  

## Next Steps  

I will continue sharing progress and the challenges I encounter throughout the development of this system.
